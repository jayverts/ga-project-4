The plan is to create a website for my girlfriends private practice. Once of the issues she faces is around scheduling and having all her appointments in one place. 

So I am going to make an app that she and her patients will be able to schedule appointments and even schedule video chats. 

My plan is to use firebase, jquery and materialize. Let's hope I have hair left at the end of this.

Yesterday I spent a lot of time researching firebase. I was not about to get it spun up but I am going to spend the majority of the day today on it. 

I am hyped up on Yerba Mate so I am going to take advantage of this energy.
