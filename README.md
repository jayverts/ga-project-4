The plan is to create a website for my girlfriends private practice. Once of the issues she faces is around scheduling and having all her appointments in one place. 

So I am going to make an app that she and her patients will be able to schedule appointments and even schedule video chats. 

My plan is to use firebase, jquery and materialize. Let's hope I have hair left at the end of this.

Yesterday I spent a lot of time researching firebase. I was not about to get it spun up but I am going to spend the majority of the day today on it. 

I am hyped up on Yerba Mate so I am going to take advantage of this energy.

Still can't get the firebase database and Auth to work. Today is going to be spent mostly working through that trying to get it at least to show me something.

Working through some bugs but I think I made a break through. I have the database CRUDable and you can log in with the usering being saved to the database.

Today I am going to try to put some CSS into it. I need to start preparing this thing to present. We will see how it goes!
